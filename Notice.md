# NOTICE

This project was created with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. Copilot provides suggestions for code and documentation based on the context of your code, and can help you write code more quickly and efficiently.

While Copilot can be a helpful tool, it's important to remember that it's not a replacement for human expertise and judgement. You should always review and test the code generated by Copilot to ensure that it meets your requirements and is free of bugs and security vulnerabilities.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of Copilot in this project, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're committed to using technology responsibly and ethically, and we welcome feedback from our users.
